# Sneaker-Sight
A simple image recognition app that detects if the sneakers are Jordans or Yeezys shoe brand.

## Summary
A project to implement basic machine learning for iOS apps, using Apple's CreateML, CoreML, and 
Vision frameworks.

### Data Prep
I utilized Apple's CreateML to train a custom image classifer for sneakers. For training data, 
I gathered 70 images each of Air Jordan 1 and Yeezy Boost 350 shoes and 15 images for my testing data. 
Using only 70 images and two shoe types was for simplicity. 
Accuracy of model was 75%. 

### Possible Improvements 
 Gather a much larger dataset with diverse shoe types and brands so image recognition wouldn't be limited to only two types.
