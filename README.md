# Sneaker-Sight
A simple image recognition app that detects if the sneakers are Jordans or Yeezys shoe brand.

## Summary
This was a personal project to implement basic machine learning for iOS apps, using Apple's CreateML, CoreML, and 
Vision frameworks.

I utilized Apple's CreateML to train a custom image classifer for sneakers. For training data, 
I gathered 70 images each of Air Jordan 1 and Yeezy Boost 350 shoes and 15 images for my testing data. 
Using only 70 images and two shoe types was for simplicity. 
Accuracy of model was 75% due to a small dataset
